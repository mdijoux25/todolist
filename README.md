# A NodeJs ToDo List that i build myself '!'

I want to improve my skill in NodeJs so i decide to build me a ToDo List with feature that i will use everyday in my job.
I will document every step that i do in my journey to the perfect ToDo List (for me )

## Beginning

i think the first thing to do is to decide the architecture of the ToDoList App.
i draw a schema for that and i will making change during my dev.
